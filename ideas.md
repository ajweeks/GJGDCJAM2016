## Ideas
---
- Top down
    - Mouse is restricted to certain areas (if it touches a wall you lose)
    - Four types of areas:
        0. Outside the level, neither can be inside         (Black)
        1. The player and the mouse can be inside           (Light cyan)
        2. Only the player can be inside                    (Red)
        3. Only the mouse can be inside                     (Green)
    - Puzzle? (fast-paced, like the impossible game)
    - Coins? (not sure what for)
